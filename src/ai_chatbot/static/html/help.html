    <h2>Train delay prediction</h2>
    <p>
    This chatbot can also predict train delay also. For example:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    "Can you please let me know the delay on my train from Norwich that was supposed to leave at 1pm, and left at 1:20pm, going to London Liverpool Street to arrive at 3pm, and we just passed Colchester at 2:30pm."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    You will need to put the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The departure station name</li>
      <li>The departure station's supposed to leave time (planned time)</li>
      <li>The departure station's actually left time (actual time)</li>
      <li>The arrival station name</li>
      <li>The arrival station's supposed to arrival time (planned time)</li>
      <li>The station you just passed name</li>
      <li>The departure of the station you just passed (actual time)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Voice recognition and synthesis</h2>
    <p>
    You need Chrome/Chromium in order to use voice recognition, voice synthesis is supported by most major browsers. You can disable/enable both recognition and synthesis features with the two buttons ("Start/Stop Voice Recognition" and "Enable/Disable text to speech") below the text input.
